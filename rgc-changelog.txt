3.2
- global variables added (usable in chains sequences and automation)
- new actions for automation and new bonds for chains sequences:
	- setting number of execution of other action
	- setting execution counter of other chain sequence
- bug fixes
3.1
- gpio inputs fixed and reworked:
	- two methods avalible for state change detection (loop monitoring and edge detection)
	- resistor of pi can now be choosed
	- configurable cpu rest time for loop monitoring method
	- configurable switch bounce time for edge detection method
- logs for execution chains can now be disabled
- android client can now have secondary ip and port set, (used when connected to specefid wifi network) 

3.0.2
- bugs and layout fixes 

3.0.1
- chains:
	- can now be run in limited or unlimited loop
	- can now be run as bond of other chain
- bug fixes

3.0 
Update from prevoius versions not posible ! Check install instructions !
- sqlite db changed to postgresql
- config/startup parameters are set now via config file (rgc-config.ini)
- radio frequency support // 433/315Mhz cheap modules can be used to transmit or recive codes, web client have option to sniff codes
- custom shell commands // allows to run own script or bash command from clients
- linked pi's // allows to link multiple pi devices
- sensors:
    - rotary encoder and range sensor support added // both configurable in rgc-config.ini
    - custom sensor definition // allows to create custom sensor based on own script (script must return/print numeric value)
    - android widget added
- advenced sheduled actions renamed to automation and enhanced:
    - single action creates system process and runs indepedently, with use of all cpu cores
    - posibility to transmit rf code or run custom command on triggers conditions met
    - configurable triggers check refresh rate // how often triggers condition will be checked (in seconds or fraction of second)
    - new triggers types: RF recive, cmd output, linked pi(i/o state / sensor value / rf recive)
- chains:
    - posibility to create bonds based of linked pi
    - android widget added
- gpio inputs:
    - enhanced to use less cpu power
    - binding options removed // same thing can now be done with automation action


2.1
- built in web client added
- tcp only option for android
- ping trigger added
- old scheduled actions removed
- bug fixes
2.0
- reworked and improved connection, now it's multithreded server UDP(for small data)/TCP(for large data)
- server now runs as a service of systemd
Added:
- Execution chains // allows to create chains from bonds output/pwm/conditional that will be run with one by one with defined daley
- Advenced sheduled action // more enhanced version of previous functionality with posibility to set multiple trigers and conjunction
- Sensors // easy read/store data from sensors: DS18B20, DHT*, TSL2561
- Notifications // settup notification base on output/input status or sensor value
- ON/OFF Widget // change output state from android home screen
- Other smaller fixes and improvments
