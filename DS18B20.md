Add the following lines to /boot/config.txt:
```bash
dtoverlay=w1-gpio
```

Enable the 1-Wire protocol with it:
```bash
sudo modprobe w1-gpio
sudo modprobe w1-therm
```
We can find out if it worked by entering the following:
```bash
lsmod
```
The modules should now be listed, if not a GPIO pin other than 4 is used or an error occurred while activating.

So that the modules are loaded at every start, we enter them into the file /etc/modules:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/modules
```
and last add the following two lines:
```bash
w1_gpio
w1_therm
```

Finally reboot:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

Now check if sensors are visible:
```bash
cd /sys/bus/w1/devices/
ls
```
